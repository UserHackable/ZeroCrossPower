## Zero Crossing Detector and Power Supply

I used this board in my Range Rebuild to give me zero crossing detection, as well as provide power using a simple AC wall wart style transformer, and a linear regulator. 

This allows me to drive my solid state relays at zero crossing, and use the inherent frequency of the power line as the clock for a very slow PWM for power control.
